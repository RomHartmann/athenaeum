Articles I want to keep
----------------
A collection of articles with short descriptions to them.  Articles are generally about Data Engineering, Data Science, Finance and Life.  I save only those that I might want to refer back to.  
This is totally a copy of https://github.com/sderosiaux/every-single-day-i-tldr, but for my own reference.
